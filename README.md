## UNC Data Analytics Bootcamp Module 10: Advanced SQL Homework

### SQL-Alchemy Challenge: Hawaiian Vacation

This repository contains materials for Module 10 of the UNC Data Analytics Program, focusing on Advanced SQL techniques including SQLAlchemy. It includes CSV datasets and sqlite data, a Jupyter Notebook, and a Python file which runs a Flask app.

The `Resources` folder contains CSV files with information on weather stations in Hawaii and the data collected from those stations from 1/1/2010 to 8/23/2017. It also includes a sqlite schema with the same information.

### Files Included

- **climate_starter.ipynb**: Jupyter Notebook demonstrating how to read the CSV files and perform analysis using pandas.
- **app.py**: Python script containing the Flask application with routes for accessing the data stored in the database.

## Usage

1. Clone the repository to your local machine.
2. Execute the code in the **climate_starter.ipynb** file to load the `hawaii.sqlite` database.
3. Run the `app.py` file and navigate through the available URL paths to view the data in your browser.
